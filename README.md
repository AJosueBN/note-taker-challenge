# Technologies involved in this project include the use of Express , JavaScript and Node.

# Things added/implemented to the task of modifying a Note Taker App:

- Will be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page once the app has been open and can click through the link , displaying an existing notes page along with empty fiels to enter note title & note text within the page
- Can save new note title and note text the user has written once I click on the save icon and will display on the left-hand column
- When the user will be able to click on the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page , the user will be presented with empty fields to enter new note title and note's text in the right-hand column whilst also being able to click on the notes created previously
- Can click on the delete button, and the note title along with the note's text is erased from the landing page
- Notes have an unique note id identifier to identify the notes created on the landing page
